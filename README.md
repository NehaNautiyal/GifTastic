## Overview 

This app uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with 10 gifs of any element on the Periodic Table. 

## Technologies Used

* CSS
* Javascript
* jQuery
* GIPHY API

## How it Works

You can click on any current button to generate gifs, or write your own element to add a button.
Once the gifs are displayed, the rating is shown and a link to a Periodic Table to learn more about the element. 
Click on the gif to play it, and click it again to stop it.
You can also Download the gif or click on the star to make the gif your "favorite" as you click more buttons to display other gifs.
